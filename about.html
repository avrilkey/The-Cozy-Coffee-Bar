        over ten wonderful years in counting. <b>The Cozy Coffee Bar</b> is not just a coffee shop,
        but its a place we hope all of our customers find comfort in. We serve great tasting, 
        affordable drinks and bakery items that you can enjoy alone, with an old friend or a 
        new friend you meet here. We see our customers as family and wether they are new or frequent visitors,
